			<span>Pubg Mobile Esports (PME) came into basing through the initiation of five board members (Suraj Dangol, Sangram Singh Deuja, Jyoti Ratna Bajracharya, Bimal Tamrakar, Gopal Timsina) who are Infotech professionals and fans of electronic games.

A lot of credit goes to the President of Nepal Olympic Committee, Mr. Jeeven Ram Shrestha, without whose support the PME would still be an aimless, un-organised body. His perpetual cooperation has been an essential contribution in establishing PME as an official body governing e-sports activities in Nepal. The recognition from the Nepal Olympic Committee helped us to gain confidence from the government as well and helped us to get membership as esporting nation in International Esports Federation (IESF).
